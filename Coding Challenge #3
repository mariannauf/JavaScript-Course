//Coding Challenge #3
/*There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
as well (draw means they have the same average score) 

Test data:
* Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110 */

const playOneDolphins = 96;
const playTwoDolphins = 108;
const playThreeDolphins = 89;

const playOneKoalas = 88;
const playTwoKoalas = 91;
const playThreeKoalas = 110;

//1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below

const avgDolphins = (playOneDolphins + playTwoDolphins + playThreeDolphins) / 3;

const avgKoalas = (playOneKoalas + playTwoKoalas + playThreeKoalas) / 3;

//2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
//and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
//as well (draw means they have the same average score) 

if (avgDolphins > avgKoalas) {
    console.log(`The DOLPHINS have WON the TROPHY!!!`);
}
else if (avgDolphins === avgKoalas) {
    console.log(`There is a DRAW on the competition! BOTH of the teams get the Trophy!`);
}
else if (avgKoalas > avgDolphins) {
    console.log(`The KOALAS have WON the TROPHY!!!`);
}

// Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰

const playOneDolphins1 = 97;
const playTwoDolphins1 = 112;
const playThreeDolphins1 = 101;

const playOneKoalas1 = 109;
const playTwoKoalas1 = 95;
const playThreeKoalas1 = 123;

const avgDolphins1 = (playOneDolphins1 + playTwoDolphins1 + playThreeDolphins1) / 3;

const avgKoalas1 = (playOneKoalas1 + playTwoKoalas1 + playThreeKoalas1) / 3;

if (avgDolphins1 > avgKoalas1 && avgDolphins1 >= 100) {
    console.log(`The DOLPHINS have WON the TROPHY!!!`);
}
else if (avgDolphins1 === avgKoalas1) {
    console.log(`There is a DRAW on the competition! BOTH of the teams get the Trophy!`);
}
else if (avgKoalas1 > avgDolphins1 && avgKoalas1 >= 100) {
    console.log(`The KOALAS have WON the TROPHY!!!`);
}

// Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy

const playOneDolphins2 = 97;
const playTwoDolphins2 = 112;
const playThreeDolphins2 = 101;

const playThreeKoalas2 = 106;

const avgDolphins2 = (playOneDolphins2 + playTwoDolphins2 + playThreeDolphins2) / 3;

const avgKoalas2 = (playOneKoalas2 + playTwoKoalas2 + playThreeKoalas2) / 3;

if (avgDolphins2 > avgKoalas2 && avgDolphins2 > 100) {
    console.log(`The DOLPHINS have WON the TROPHY!!!`);
}
else if (avgDolphins2 === avgKoalas2 && avgKoalas2 >= 100 && avgDolphins2 >= 100) {
