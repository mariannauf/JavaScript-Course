//Coding Challenge #1

// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:

// BMI = mass / height ** 2   or   mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

//Test data 1:
const weightMark1 = 78; //Mark weights 78kg
const heightMark1 = 1.69; //Mark's height is 1.69m tall
const weightJohn1 = 92; //John weights 92kg
const heightJohn1 = 1.95; //John's height is 1.95m tall

//1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
console.log("Question 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables");
console.log("\n Mark weights: " + weightMark1 + 'kg \n and is ' + heightMark1 + ' centimeters tall');
console.log('\n John weights: ' + weightJohn1 + 'kg \n and is ' + heightJohn1 + ' centimeters tall');


//2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula
console.log("\n Question 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula ");
const bmiMark1 = (weightMark1 / (heightMark1 ** 2));
console.log("\n Mark's BMI is: " + bmiMark1);

const bmiJohn1 = (weightJohn1 / (heightJohn1 ** 2));
console.log("\n John's BMI is: " + bmiJohn1);

// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

const markHigherBMI1 = (bmiMark1 > bmiJohn1);
console.log('\ntrue/false does Mark have a higher BMI than John? \n' + markHigherBMI1);



//test data 2:
const weightMark2 = 95; //Mark weights 95kg
const heightMark2 = 1.88; //Mark's height is 1.88m tall
const weightJohn2 = 85; //John weights 85kg
const heightJohn2 = 1.76; //John's height is 1.75m tall

//1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
console.log('\n \n \n' + "Question 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables (test data 2)");

console.log("\n Mark weights: " + weightMark2 + 'kg \n and is ' + heightMark2 + ' centimeters tall');
console.log('\n John weights: ' + weightJohn2 + 'kg \n and is ' + heightJohn2 + ' centimeters tall');

//2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula
console.log("\n Question 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (test data 2)");

const bmiMark2 = (weightMark2 / (heightMark2 ** 2));
console.log("\n Mark's BMI is: " + bmiMark2);

const bmiJohn2 = (weightJohn2 / (heightJohn2 ** 2));
console.log("\n John's BMI is: " + bmiJohn2);

// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

const markHigherBMI2 = (bmiMark2 > bmiJohn2);
console.log('\ntrue/false does Mark have a higher BMI than John? (test data 2) \n' + markHigherBMI2);
