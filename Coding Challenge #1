//Coding Challenge #1

// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:

// BMI = mass / height ** 2   or   mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

//Test data 1:
const weightMark1 = 78; //Mark weights 78kg
const heightMark1 = 1.69; //Mark's height is 1.69m tall
const weightJohn1 = 92; //John weights 92kg
const heightJohn1 = 1.95; //John's height is 1.95m tall

//1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// console.log("Question 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables");
// console.log("\n Mark weights: " + weightMark1 + 'kg \n and is ' + heightMark1 + ' centimeters tall');
// console.log('\n John weights: ' + weightJohn1 + 'kg \n and is ' + heightJohn1 + ' centimeters tall');
